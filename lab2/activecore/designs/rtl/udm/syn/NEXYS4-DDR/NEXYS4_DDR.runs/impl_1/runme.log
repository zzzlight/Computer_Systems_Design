WARNING: [DRC NSTD-3] Undefined I/O Standard alert: 35 out of 36 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'UNDEFINED' or 'DIFF_UNDEFINED', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. Problem ports: LED[15:0], SW[15:0], CLK100MHZ, UART_RXD_OUT, and UART_TXD_IN.

This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. Problem ports: LED[15:0], SW[15:0], CLK100MHZ, UART_RXD_OUT, and UART_TXD_IN.
